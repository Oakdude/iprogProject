## Flag Game!

Our idea is to create a geography game consisting of primarily guessing flags. The game will have two different game modes. One is guessing a flag with four country options. The other one is to pick the correct country from a map given a flag. 
The vision is for the player to be able to pick a difficulty level and continents. 
A score will also be stored.
